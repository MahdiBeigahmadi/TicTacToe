To execute algorithms for 4x4 and 5x5 grids, please exercise patience.
The state space for these grids is considerably large, which means the code may take time to calculate each move.
It's important not to terminate the code execution prematurely.
As the game progresses, be prepared for the possibility that each step could take several minutes.
